# Example Code for Scaladays Talk
## Your Scala Type System Working for You

This repo contains example code used during the above talk.

The slides for the talk (in PDF) are at https://www.dropbox.com/s/dfmxzkq0ue2qpc5/Your%20Scala%20Type%20System%20Working%20For%20You.pdf?dl=0 

The code here is not a complete project and is just enough to support the talk.
If you dig in you will find a lot of "just enough" scaffolding (imagine a wild
west movie set in a studio - lots of wooden building facades).

In time, some of these ideas may be put into a more complete geospatial scala API.
